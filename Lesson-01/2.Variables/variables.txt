Variables: Allocated space in memory to store a value. We refer to a variables's name to access the store
           value. That variable now behaves as if it was the value it contains. But we need to declare what type
           of data we are storing.

         ###.  format:

                1.  datatype variableName;
                    variableName = value;

                2. dataType variableName = value;

         ###.   As strings are technically objects and C programming is 
            not a object oriented programming, as a result we wont see any data type called "STRING".
            In place of string datatype we will use a array that can print a series of characters.
